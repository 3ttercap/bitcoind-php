===================

This project is a wrapper for a bitcoind daemon. This project is still being
worked on and the interface may change a little until I get something more
stable.

## Installation

You can install this library by using [Composer]. You can also view more info
about this on [Packagist].

Add this to the `requires` in your `composer.json` file.

    "nbobtc/bitcoind-php": "~1.2"

## Usage

To use the project you need to just create a new instance of the class.

    <?php

    use Nbobtc\Bitcoind\Bitcoind;
    use Nbobtc\Bitcoind\Client;

    $bitcoind = new Bitcoind(new Client('https://username:password@localhost:18332'));

You can view the [BitcoindInterface] file for a list of methods and descriptions
of what they are and how to use them.

## Tests

To run the tests you need to install the development packages using composer

    php composer.phar install --dev

Once this is complete you can run phpunit

    ./bin/phpunit

The API Documentation can be generated by install composer development packages
like so:
